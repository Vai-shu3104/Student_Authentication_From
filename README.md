Student Authentication From
The Student Authentication System is a web-based application developed using the Django framework with MySQL database integration.
This project provides basic authentication functionality where students can register, log in, view their dashboard, and log out securely.  
Student data such as Full Name, Email, Mobile Number, and Password is stored in a MySQL database. Passwords are saved in hashed format to ensure security.
After successful login, the student is redirected to a dashboard page where their name and email are displayed.  
The application uses session-based authentication to restrict access to protected pages like the dashboard.
This project helps in understanding core Django concepts such as models, views, URL routing, templates, forms, database connectivity, and session management. 
It is suitable for academic projects and beginners learning Django with MySQL.
